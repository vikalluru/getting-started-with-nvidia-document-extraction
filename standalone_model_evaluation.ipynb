To perform fatigue tests, the UFTM adopts the following devices: (i) an electric generator (Branson DCX 4 kW, not visible in Figure 1) which generates an electrical sinusoidal wave at 20 kHz; (ii) a piezoelectric transducer, responsible for converting the electrical wave into a mechanical vibration; (iii) a booster and a horn made of Ti-6Al-4V that amplify and convey the vibration to the specimen under testing; (iv) the specimen under investigation, which was designed for the UFTM resonance conditions; (v) a laser displacement sensor that measures the displacement at the specimen free end; (vi) vortex tubes to keep the temperature controlled in the range (20-24) \\\\(^\\\\circ\\\\)C; and (vii) a temperature sensor to observe the temperature evolution during the test execution.',\n",

The UFTM can perform tests at 20 : 0.5 kHz under fully reversed tension-compression stress (R ===17 -1), which significantly reduces the testing time compared to conventional testing apparatuses. To perform fatigue tests, the UFTM adopts the following devices: (i) an electric generator (Branson DCX kW, not visible in Figure 1) which generates an electrical sinusoidal wave at 20 kHz; (ii) piezoelectric transducer, responsible for converting the electrical wave into mechanical vibration; (iii) booster and a horn made of Ti-6Al-4V that amplify and convey the vibration to the specimen under testing; (iv) the specimen under investigation, which was designed for the UFTM resonance conditions; (v) a laser displacement sensor that measures the displacement at the specimen free end; (vi) vortex tubes to keep the temperature controlled in the range (20-24) \"C; and (vii) a temperature sensor to observe the temperature evolution during the test execution.',\n",
